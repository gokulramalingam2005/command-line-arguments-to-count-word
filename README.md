# command-line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Import sys module

### Step 2:
Open the file with sys.argv[1]

### Step 3:
Use the for loop to select the content in file

### Step 4:
Use split function to to separate the file content into words or strings

### Step 5:
Count the length of the words using len

### Step 6:
Print the number of words.

## PROGRAM:
```
Program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments
Developed by: gokul r
RegisterNumber: 22009260

import sys
fp=open(sys.argv[1], 'r')
count=0
for line in fp:
    list1=line.split()
    count+=len(list1)
print("No of words in a file",count)
```

### OUTPUT:

![word_count](https://github.com/A-Thiyagarajan/command-line-arguments-to-count-word/assets/118707693/dd500c0c-a973-4945-baad-6c6094e2e047)


## RESULT:
Thus the program is written to find the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
